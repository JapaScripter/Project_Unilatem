DISCLAIMER

HighTech...ish (Regular) is NOT an entirely original work. It's based on a font I used in a computer game I made around 2008. I no longer own the original font, I can't remember what it was called and it seems to have disappeared completely from the Internet (and believe me, I spent a hell of a lot of time looking), so I tried to remake it myself, using screenshots of the game as the basis to draw some of the characters.

These are the characters contained in the screenshots in high quality (i.e. the ones that look nearly identical to the original font):

- capital letters except D, J, K, Q, V, Y, Z
- lowercase A, I, N, P, T (good quality)

And these were also featured in the screenshots, but in poor quality (roughly 16 x 16 pixels in size), so redrawing them involved a bit of guesswork:

- capital Y
- lowercase letters except B, H, J, Q, V, X, Y, Z

So, those letters look almost identical to the original typeface. The other letters, as well as numbers, portuguese/spanish/french/german support characters, punctuation signs and other miscellaneous glyphs were made from scratch, as well as the "Pixelated" and "Blocky" variants of the font. I also made several improvements to some of the original characters, especially the 16x16 pixel ones.

All in all, I think it's fair to say HighTech...ish is a mostly original work, and I'm very proud of how it looks as a whole. However, I do not wish to rip off anyone's work - in fact, I am still *very* interested in finding the old typeface I used in my game. So, if you know what it is and/or where I can find it, please contact me using the email provided below.
